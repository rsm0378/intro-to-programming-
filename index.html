By now each of you have sent me an email with your schedule for arrivals and departures from Hartsfield International Airport, located in Atlanta GA. Due to the multiple flight times and carriers utilizied, I’ve attached a link on how to navigate our super confusing airport for your review <A href="http://www.atl.com/maps/"><em>Airport Map</em></a>. Each day will have a list of general activities planned along with the estimated start and stop times for each activity. These events are optional and but may not all of them may not be suitable for both children and adults. Family members will children 10 and below I've confirmed that Jade willing to babysite kids for a "small fee" :-).
